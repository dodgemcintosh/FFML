# F.F.M.L. — Fantasy Football Machine Learning

![FFML-logo](https://github.com/dodgemcintosh/FFML/blob/master/assets/FFML-logo-1%20copy.png)

This was probably long overdue _buuuuuuutttttt_ I'm finally going to attempt to marry the two things that I currently spend most of my professional time and leisure time on:

1. Data Science and Machine Learning
2. Fantasy Football

I admittedly spend too much time reading fantasy football news and articles (yes, there's currently a tab open right now), so I've decided that if I'm going to make decisions about who to draft, who to start/sit each week, and weekly and season-long player scoring projections, that I want to have a hand in crafting those metrics.

## The Big Picture

Ultimately, I want to have some fun with this while getting to practice much of my data science toolkit on something that I've come to enjoy tremendously over the years. If I can get player and/or team projections to a point where I'm outperforming current industry experts...well that will just be gravy :P

Some of the skills I envision sharpening over the course of this project are:

- **Data Acquisition**
    - This will largely be web scraping from various NFL stats aggregation sites.
    - Will get to use the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and (maybe) `Selenium` libraries to accomplish this.

- **Data Wrangling**
    - Being able to take all of that information and getting it into a format that will be easier to work with is going to take a hell of a lot of `Pandas`.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
    - A bit of a reach goal but one that I'm determined to follow through on is being able to scrape a large number of articles written by fantasy sites, major sports news outlets, betting sites, and local beat reporters.
    - In the end, I'll want to use some NLP techniques to aggregate all of this information, process it, and hopefully draw some meaningful insights out of it.

- **Data Visualization and Storytelling**
    - After everything has been collected and cleaned up a bit, I know I'll be able to do some pretty awesome visualizations and historical analytics.
    - I'll be working on even further refining my `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `Tableau` skills, and hopefully will be able to even get my hands dirty with some `D3.js`.
    - Throughout this entire process, but in this section specifically, I'd like to continue to refine my writing. It's something that I've always enjoyed doing (and thought I was decent at), so I'm really looking forward to it.
    - With data science, I've always placed a premium on my skills in that arena — if you can't effectively communicate what you've found, all your cool modeling is for nothing.

- **Machine Learning / Predictive Modeling**
    - Anddddd for the stuff that everyone is clamoring for. The stuff that brings me back to the same sites time and time again — that enticing promise of knowing the future and having some sort of an edge over your friends / co-workers / league-mates.
    - Lots of `scikit-learn` here, with some `TensorFlow` and `Keras` thrown in as well.
    - We'll see how the actual predictions turn out...hopefully better than my March Madness ones! LOLZ

### Prerequisites
